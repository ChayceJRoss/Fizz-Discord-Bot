# DiscordBot
A bot for the UBC Engineering Physics Discord Server. Hosted using Heroku.

This bot was initially for my personal server, but was repurposed for use in the UBC Engineering Physics Discord.

## Commands:
__Prefix:__ sudo <command> 

__s/shake @target:__ "Shakes" the target between two designated channels by moving them back and forth quickly. Intended to notify deafeded users
to undeafen. Additionally the bot will PM the target.

__airstrike @target:__ Same as shake but with far more PMs (Use sparringly).

__gag @target:__ Deletes all new messages sent by target (More fun than removing their permissions)
